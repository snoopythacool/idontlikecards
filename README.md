Hi

If you're reading this, I assume that you came from my portofolios.

Unfortunately, the website haven't been working for quite a while... And I am too drowned in my IB curriculum to fix it! I assume it's something to do with Render.

However, feel free to have a look at my codes. This repo is for the main application, which connects the clients with idontlikecards_api.
